# Oneshot 3D models

This repository contains models in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) that will hardly be used more then once. Regardless of this, they might still improve ~~[Q++ library](https://github.com/kubikji2/qpp-openscad-library)~~ [solid++ library](https://github.com/kubikji2/solidpp) or be used for debugging it.

## Roadmap

- No particular goals; just move models from other repositories here.
